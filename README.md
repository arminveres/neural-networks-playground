# neural-networks-playground

A playground for Simulations in Natural Sciences project revolving around Artificial Neural Networks

To make learning faster, I am using my AMD gpu and it's hip capabilites, [link](https://docs.amd.com/bundle/ROCm-Deep-Learning-Guide-v5.4.3/page/Frameworks_Installation.html#d2839e1290).

For that I will be using their docker setup since fedora is a pain to install ROCm for.

```bash
docker pull rocm/pytorch:latest
```

ATTENTION: This will use **35GB of your storage!!!**
